Aerial silk web page in making 

My name is Mateja Su≈°a. I have a super dog - Juka. Juka is an 8 months old labrador retriever puppy. She was supposed to be an assistance dog, but the universe set her up with me. We are a team and we go everywhere together. Now, we are learning how to make a web page and how to be "in time" with computer language and programs. I am a preschool teacher eager to learn other things. I have a passion for aerial silk, I'm actually a trainer with a diploma on a shelf. Not so good, I know. For a start, I would like to make a web page and an e-book about my passion - aerial silk. Also, I think I am a creative, problem-solving, happy face, team work person, but ready to make it alone. If I bite for something that I like, I don't let go. Furthermore, I'm finding a happy place with my work. Oh, I also played the piano for 7 years, and a contrabass for a year. I love music and people who respect music.
